# Frontend mockup

This folder contains a minimal Vite + React mockup for onboarding and module selection.

Run locally:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL in your browser (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes: OTP sending is mocked in-browser (you'll see the generated code via alert). This is a UI prototype and doesn't include a backend.
